# HidCerberus Service

Companion service to manage HidGuardian device blocking and process whitelisting.

---

This was a research project and an attempt of turning the proof of concept project [HideDS4](https://github.com/nefarius/HideDS4) into a Windows kernel-mode filter driver that allows system-wide hiding of joysticks and gamepads, addressing doubled-input issues in games running with remapping utilities. It has been discontinued [in favour of better solutions](https://github.com/ViGEm/HidHide). The code will stay up for anyone to use as either an inspiration or a negative example ðŸ˜œ Do bear in mind, that the code may contain unaddressed issues! Compile and use at your own risk! No support or binaries provided!

---

The HidCerberus Service abstracts away configuration tasks for the [HidGuardian Device Driver](../../../HidGuardian) and allows literally any 3rd party tool to interact with the driver via HTTP REST API.

## 3rd party dependencies

The following dependency libraries will be automatically resolved via [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/) on first build.

- [NancyFx](http://nancyfx.org/)
- [Topshelf](http://topshelf-project.com/)
- [Fody](https://github.com/Fody/Fody)
- [Fody Costura](https://github.com/Fody/Costura)

## Manual Installation

- Either run `HidCerberus.Srv.exe` standalone or install it as a Windows Service with `HidCerberus.Srv.exe install` in an elevated command prompt.
- While you're in an elevated prompt, start the service with `HidCerberus.Srv.exe start`
- You should now be able to navigate to the [configuration page](http://localhost:26762/).
